        <h2>This page should be light blue.</h2>
        <p>The first challenge I've issued myself as I venture into the world of styling will be to make the seven div's
            below into a rainbow projecting a GIF out of the page.</p>
    </div>

    <div id=fedUp>
        <h2>FINE. Those divs up there are FINE.</h2>
        <p>I had blissfully forgotten how much I loathe CSS. But here goes:</p>
    </div>
    <div id="wrapper">
        <div id="red"></div>
        <div id="orange"></div>
        <div id="yellow"></div>
        <div id="green"></div>
        <div id="blue"></div>
        <div id="violet"></div>
        <div id="dash">
            <img src="https://derpicdn.net/img/2013/3/30/283623/full.gif" height="100%" width="100%" />
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="success">
        <h2>Well that worked... eventually.</h2>
        <p>It involved a good deal more typing than I wanted to do. I bet if I'd nested the divs within one another I
            could have used a single class definition and made it much simpler. Perhaps I'll refactor in the future to
            make it more dry. DRY. Don't Repeat Yourself. At the moment, however, I'm content to leave it wet. WET. We
            Enjoy Typing.</p>
        <p>Anyway, next I think we'll do some Bootstrap.</p>
