    <h1>First, we have some forms for you to fill out.</h1>

    <p>It occurs to me that I may as well put some more HTML elements in here just so I can have the practice.</p>
    <p>The forms below are just for my practice building the UI. They don't do anything. At least not currently. Raj always used to make us type everything out in our group projects becaue it is better practice than copy and pasting, which is what just about everyone does.</p>
    <p>Perhaps in the future I will copy and paste these from here and hook them up to a backend of some sort, but as for now I just want the practice building them. It's the weekend and I don't feel like starting a whole new thing, so I'm just going to practice.</p>
