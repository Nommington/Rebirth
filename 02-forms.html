    <title>Different Kinds of Forms</title>

    <h1>First, we have some forms for you to fill out.</h1>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cS8i5vC.gif" alt="Papers, please!" />

    <p>It occurs to me that I may as well put some more HTML elements in here just so I can have the practice.</p>
    <p>The forms below are just for my practice building the UI. They don't do anything. At least not currently. Raj
        always used to make us type everything out in our group projects becaue it is better practice than copy and
        pasting, which is what just about everyone does.</p>
    <p>Perhaps in the future I will copy and paste these from here and hook them up to a backend of some sort, but as
        for now I just want the practice building them. It's the weekend and I don't feel like starting a whole new
        thing, so I'm just going to practice.</p>

    <h1>Anyway, the forms (please remember, they do NOTHING):</h1>
    <h2>This Form does nothing.</h2>

    <form action="#">
        <p>This one's just a text field with max length 10:
            <input type="text" name="whatever" size="30" maxlength="10" />
            Even though the field is long enough for 30.
        </p>
    </form>

    <form action="#">
        <p>This one is for SECRET TYPING:
            <input type="password" name="secret" size="20" maxlength="10" />
        </p>
    </form>

    <form action="#">
        <p>Those forms didn't really give you enough room to type, did they? Here's one with a big ol' text field for
            ya:</p>
        <textarea name="area" cols="20" rows="4">Go nuts...</textarea>
        <p>"Go nuts..." will stay in the window so it'll need to be deleted whenever you fill it out. I can fix later
            that with JavaScript.</p>
    </form>

    <form action="#">
        <p>Please select one from the following:
            <input type="radio" name="choice" value="this" checked="checked" />This
            <input type="radio" name="choice" value="that" />That
            <input type="radio" name="choice" value="theOther" />The Other
        </p>
    </form>

    <form action="#">
        <p>Select as many as you like of these options:
            <input type="checkbox" name="option" value="thisOne" />This One
            <input type="checkbox" name="option" value="thatOne" />That One
            <input type="checkbox" name="option" value="theOtherOne" />The Other One
        </p>
    </form>

    <form action="#">
        <p>Here's a drop-down list!</p>
        <select name="choices">
            <option value="one">One</option>
            <option value="two">Two</option>
            <option value="three">Three</option>
        </select>
    </form>

    <form action="#">
        <p>This list isn't drop-down at all! And you can select more than one!</p>
        <select name="choices2" size="3" multiple="multiple">
            <option value="first">First Option</option>
            <option value="second">Second Option</option>
            <option value="third">Third Option</option>
        </select>
    </form>

    <form action="#" method="POST">
        <p>Here, upload a file... to NOWHERE!</p>
        <input type="file" name="file" />
        <input type="submit" value="Upload!" />
    </form>
